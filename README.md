## Features

- **Smart AI Opponent**: Uses minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimal gameplay
- **Random First Move**: Either the player or AI randomly gets the first move each game
- **Visual Win Indicators**: Red lines appear through winning combinations
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern interface that works on all devices
- **Play Again Functionality**: Easy game reset with new random first player selection

## Game Rules

- Players take turns placing X's and O's on a 3x3 grid
- The player uses 'X' and the AI uses 'O'
- First to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
- If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw

## Technical Features

### AI Implementation
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Ensures the AI plays optimally
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimizes AI decision-making speed
- **Difficulty**: The AI is unbeatable when playing optimally

### Visual Enhancements
- **Winning Line Display**: Red lines highlight the winning combination
- **Different Line Types**: 
  - Horizontal lines for row wins
  - Vertical lines for column wins
  - Diagonal lines for diagonal wins
- **Game State Management**: Proper turn handling and game over detection

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Flask

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```

2. **Install Flask** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   - Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
   - If port 5000 is busy, the app will suggest an alternative port

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Open the application in your browser
2. **Random First Move**: The game randomly decides who goes first
3. **Make Your Move**: Click on any empty cell to place your 'X'
4. **AI Response**: The AI will automatically make its move with 'O'
5. **Win Condition**: Get three in a row to win - a red line will highlight your winning combination
6. **Play Again**: Click the "Play Again" button to start a new game with random first player

## AI Strategy

The AI uses the **minimax algorithm** with **alpha-beta pruning**:
- Evaluates all possible future game states
- Chooses the move that maximizes its chances of winning
- Minimizes the player's chances of winning
- Results in an unbeatable AI opponent
